Email server connection options
-------------------------------

[Same as **emailjs**](https://github.com/eleith/emailjs#emailserverconnectoptions).


Message and attachments options
-------------------------------

Same as **emailjs**:

**Message:**

```
// headers is an object ('from' and 'to' are required)
// returns a Message object

// you can actually pass more message headers than listed, the below are just the
// most common ones you would want to use

headers =
{
    text        // text of the email
    from        // sender of the format (address or name <address> or "name" <address>)
    to          // recipients (same format as above), multiple recipients are separated by a comma
    cc          // carbon copied recipients (same format as above)
    bcc     // blind carbon copied recipients (same format as above)
    subject // string subject of the email
  attachment // one attachment or array of attachments
}
```

**Attachments**

```
// can be called multiple times, each adding a new attachment
// options is an object with the following possible keys:

options =
{
    // one of these fields is required
    path      // string to where the file is located
    data      // string of the data you want to attach
    stream    // binary stream that will provide attachment data (make sure it is in the paused state)
              // better performance for binary streams is achieved if buffer.length % (76*6) == 0
              // current max size of buffer must be no larger than Message.BUFFERSIZE

    // optionally these fields are also accepted
    type          // string of the file mime type
    name        // name to give the file as perceived by the recipient
    alternative // if true, will be attached inline as an alternative (also defaults type='text/html')
    inline      // if true, will be attached inline
    encoded     // set this to true if the data is already base64 encoded, (avoid this if possible)
    headers     // object containing header=>value pairs for inclusion in this attachment's header
    related     // an array of attachments that you want to be related to the parent attachment
}
```
